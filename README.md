This project demonstrates how to set up RabbitMQ locally using Docker and implement a simple messaging system with Node.js. The system consists of three applications: a sender that publishes a message to a RabbitMQ exchange, and two receivers that subscribe to the exchange and receive the message. Docker is used to host RabbitMQ with the management plugin, and Node.js applications interact with RabbitMQ via the amqplib library. The project showcases message broadcasting in real-time using RabbitMQ's fanout exchange.
